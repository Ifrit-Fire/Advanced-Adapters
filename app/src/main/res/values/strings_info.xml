		\t\tInitially created as a way to test the Advanced-Adapters library, this app now serves as a
		demonstration of all available adapters and their associating features found within it. The
		Advanced-Adapters library spawned out of frustration in having to constantly re-write a new
		adapter for various apps I\'ve worked on over the years. Needing a custom solution proved far
		more common then needing the generic ArrayAdapter provided by Android. While their version
		serves a basic generic purpose, it\'s filtering inconsistencies/bugs became a pain to deal
		with, ultimately requiring me to re-write their adapter any time I wanted to support
		filtering.

	<!--Info Dialog - Android's ArrayAdapter-->
	<string name="info_android_arrayadapter_title">Android\'s ArrayAdapter</string>
	<string name="info_android_arrayadapter_message">
		A large motivation to create the Advanced-Adapter library was to fix the problems found in
		Android\'s provided ArrayAdapter. The following is a demonstration of their adapter in action
		to see just how easy it is to break.  Mostly the problems revolve around the filter. Try
		doing this:\n
		\n
		\t - Perform a search\n
		\t - Close the search view\n
		\t - Attempt to add a new movie\n
		\t - Beholdâ€¦nothing is added.\n
		\t - Demo is now in a bad state.\n
		\t - Hit back and re-enter demo.\n
		\t - You\'re back in a good state.\n
		\n
		As soon as the ArrayAdapter performs one search, the Adapter can longer be
		mutated without seeing problems. Can you find any other problems? Head on over to the wiki
		to find out more issues.\n\n

	<!--Info Dialog - ArrayBaseAdapter-->
	<string name="info_array_baseadapter_title">Array BaseAdapter</string>
	<string name="info_array_baseadapter_message">
		This is a demonstration of the ArrayBaseAdapter class. It\'s backed by an ArrayList. All
		subclasses are expected to handle view generation and defining the filter comparison logic.\n
		\n
		The ArrayBaseAdapter is designed to be more flexible then Android\'s ArrayAdapter class and
		be a general goto adapter for most situations. Comparatively, it provides the following extra
		features:\n
		\n
		\t- Additional methods supporting more ArrayList APIs.\n
		\t- Smarter use of notifyDataSetChanged().\n
		\t- LayoutInflater passed to all view creation methods.\n
		\t- Resolves many outstanding filtering issues.\n
		\n
		All mutating methods are internally synchronized. This ensures a thread safe environment for
		write operations. If filtering is not required, it\'s strongly recommended to use the
		SimpleArrayBaseAdapter instead.

	<string name="info_simplearray_baseadapter_message">
		This is a demonstration of the SimpleArrayBaseAdapter class. It\'s backed by an ArrayList.
		All subclasses are expected to handle view generation.\n
 		\n
		Designed to be a simple version of it\'s cousin ArrayBaseAdapter, it removes some of the more
		"convenience" method calls while adding support for insertion. The biggest difference is the
		lack of filtering. As a result, there is no need for synchronized blocks which may help
		those worried about performance.\n

 		If filtering is required, it\'s strongly recommended to use the ArrayBaseAdapter instead.
