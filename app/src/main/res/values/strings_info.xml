		\t\tInitially created as a way to test the Advanced Adapters library, this app now serves as a
		demonstration of all available adapters and their associating features found within it. The
		Advanced Adapters library spawned out of frustration in having to constantly re-write a new
		adapter for various apps I\'ve worked on over the years. Needing a custom solution proved far
		more common then needing the generic ArrayAdapter provided by Android. While their version
		serves a basic generic purpose, it\'s filtering inconsistencies/bugs became a pain to deal
		with, ultimately requiring me to re-write their adapter any time I wanted to support
		filtering.

	<!--Info Dialog - ArrayBaseAdapter-->

	<string name="info_array_baseadapter_message">
		This is a demonstration of the ArrayBaseAdapter class. It\'s an abstract BaseAdapter that is
		backed by an ArrayList. All subclasses are expected to handle view generation and defining
		the filtering logic.\n
		\n
		The ArrayBaseAdapter is designed to be more flexible then Android\'s ArrayAdapter class and
		be a general goto adapter for most situations. Compared to the standard ArrayAdapter, it
		provides extra features such as:\n
		\n
		\t- Additional methods supporting more ArrayList APIs\n
		\t- Smarter use of notifyDataSetChanged()\n
		\t- LayoutInflater passed to all view creation methods.\n
		\t- Resolves many outstanding filtering issues\n
		\n
		Because the filtering process occurs on a background thread, all mutating methods are
		internally synchronized. This ensures a thread safe environment for write operations. If
		filtering is not required, it\'s strongly recommended to use the SimpleArrayBaseAdapter
		instead.

	<!--Info Dialog - SimpleArrayBaseAdapter-->
	<string name="info_simplearray_baseadapter_title">SimpleArray BaseAdapter</string>
	<string name="info_simplearray_baseadapter_message">
		A trimmed down version of the ArrayBaseAdapter which is similarly backed by an ArrayList of
		arbitrary objects. By default this class will delegate view generation to subclasses.\n
 		\n
		Designed to be a simple version of it\'s cousin ArrayBaseAdapter, it removes some of the more
		"convenience" method calls while adding support for insertion. The biggest difference is the
		lack of filtering. As a result, there is no need for synchronized blocks which may help
		those worried about performance.\n
		\n
 		If filtering is required, it\'s strongly recommended to use the ArrayBaseAdapter instead.
