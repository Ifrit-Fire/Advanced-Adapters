	<string name="info_array_baseadapter_title">Array BaseAdapter</string>
	<string name="info_array_baseadapter_message">
		This is a demonstration of the ArrayBaseAdapter class. It\'s an abstract BaseAdapter that is
		backed by an ArrayList. All subclasses are expected to handle view generation and defining
		the filtering logic.\n
		\n
		The ArrayBaseAdapter is designed to be more flexible then Android\'s ArrayAdapter class and
		be a general goto adapter for most situations. Compared to the standard ArrayAdapter, it
		provides extra features such as:\n
		\n
		\t- Additional methods supporting more ArrayList APIs\n
		\t- Smarter use of notifyDataSetChanged()\n
		\t- LayoutInflater passed to all view creation methods.\n
		\t- Resolves many outstanding filtering issues\n
		\n
		If filtering is not required, it\'s strongly recommended to use the SimpleArrayBaseAdapter
		instead. Because the filtering process occurs on a background thread, all mutating methods
		are internally synchronized. This ensures a thread safe environment for write operations.
